# Algos!

These are all taken from Leetcode via [Jeremy Aguilon's page](https://jeremyaguilon.me/blog/ranking_interview_questions_by_cram_score).

The way that he sets it up, we're dividing into 3 levels:

1. Study even if your interview is tomorrow and it's midnight
2. Study if you've got a week before your interview
3. Study these to get a general idea and build instincts

Here's the breakdown

## L1

- Number of Islands
- Coin Change Problem
- Minimum Window Substring
- Buying and Selling Stock
- Range Sum Query
- Merge Intervals
- Maximum Subarray

## L2

- Range Sum Query Mutable
- Counting Inversions
- Word Search II
- Task Scheduler
- Non-overlapping Intervals
- Preorder Serialization Verification of a Binary Tree

## L3

- Find Duplicate Number
- Construct BST from Preorder and Inorder Serialization
- Search an Infinitely Sized List
- Decode Ways
- Jump Game II
- Find Edit Distance Between Two Words

None of these have test cases yet, but I'm interested in setting up a CI/CD kinda situation at some point.
